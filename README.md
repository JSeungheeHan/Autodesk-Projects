## Black Phone Case

A CAD (computer assisted design) of a phone case for the model IPhone XR. Made with the purpose of 3D printing the case to use, with a white flower pattern on the back. Created via the dimensions measured on a physical IPhone.

Practical application is unviable, as when it was 3D printed, it was shown that the plastic used for 3D printing is much too fragile to be able to "snap" onto a phone, instead breaking.
