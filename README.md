## Black Phone Case

A CAD (computer assisted design) of a phone case for the model IPhone XR. Made with the purpose of 3D printing the case to use, with a white flower pattern on the back. Created via the dimensions measured on a physical IPhone.

Practical application is unviable, as when it was 3D printed, it was shown that the plastic used for 3D printing is much too fragile to be able to "snap" onto a phone, instead breaking.

## Hylian Shield

A CAD of a popular video game item, the "Hylian Shield". Made using Autodesk inventor, with lots of use of the "emboss" function in order to engrave designs onto a non-flat surface. Was 3D printed as a souvenier.

Able to be 3D printed. Initial version had a much thinner handle, but was shown that spinning small lines of plastic would result in it breaking very easily. As such, handle was made thicker.

## Master Sword

A CAD of a popular video game item, the "Master Sword". Made using Autodesk inventor, using various extrusions to give the iconic guard lots of depth. Materials were chosen from Autodesk Library Was 3D printed as a souvenier.

Able to be 3D printed. Without color, the blade looks a lot more dull, but is still very detailed. The differences in elevation between each "level" of the guard was maintained in the physical version despite being very small.

## MyRoom

An incomplete CAD model of what my home room looks like. Made using Autodesk Inventor. Items include my desk, my bed, my closet, and my bookshelf. However, a particular difficulty was creating walls without having them block the view to the inside of my room.

Not able to be 3D printed. Not only is it too small and too complex, it is not complete yet, and as such, doesn't have the structural support needed to 3D print.
